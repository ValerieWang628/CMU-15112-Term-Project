------ this the description of Schulze's Beat Path Method in Wikipedia------
source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method

The Schulze method is an electoral system 
developed in 1997 by Markus Schulze 
that selects a single winner using votes 
that express preferences. 
The method can also be used to create 
a sorted list of winners. 
The Schulze method is also known as 
Schwartz Sequential dropping (SSD), 
the beatpath method, 
beatpath winner, 
path voting, 
and path winner.

The Schulze method is a Condorcet method, 
which means that if there is a candidate 
who is preferred by a majority 
over every other candidate 
in pairwise comparisons, 
then this candidate will be the winner 
when the Schulze method is applied.

The output of the Schulze method (defined below) 
gives an ordering of candidates. 
Therefore, if several positions are available, 
the method can be used for this purpose without modification, 
by letting the k top-ranked candidates win the k available seats. 
Furthermore, for proportional representation elections, 
a single transferable vote variant has been proposed.

In voting systems, the Smith set, named after John H. Smith, 
but also known as the top cycle, or as GETCHA, 
is the smallest non-empty set of candidates 
in a particular election such that 
each member defeats every other candidate 
outside the set in a pairwise election. 
The Smith set provides one standard of optimal choice 
for an election outcome. 
Voting systems that always elect a candidate 
from the Smith set 
pass the Smith criterion 
and are said to be "Smith-efficient".

A set of candidates where every member of the set 
pairwise defeats every member outside of the set 
is known as a dominating set.

'''
this part of the code is:
with all the paths identified 
(note: both directions, such as A beats B by 2, B beats A by 3),
- calculate the pairwise winners' path strength by the positiveBeatFinder function,
(note: only one direction, such as B defeats A by 1 (3 - 2 = 1)),
- identify smith set,
and 
- calculate the beat path within the smith set
- get the final winner
