# CMU-15112-Term-Project
This repository will be my major battlefield for the CMU 15112 Term Project 
where I will create a decision-making box which is established upon the algorithms
that Professor Jonathan Caulkins taught me at the Desicion Anlysis and Multicriteria Desicion Making course.

I am excited to realize all these excel-based features with Python.
